# C Projects

These are the C project I did following [Bro Code's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87SH2Cn0s9A&t=4620s), some might not be complete or some may be missing.

## Installation

Make sure you have clang installed

Clone the repository and cd to the folder

```bash

git clone github.com/Muxutruk2/CProjects && cd CProjects

```

Compile the files

```bash

make -j $(nproc --all) # For maximum performance

```

Now you can execute any binary with `./bin/[file]`

I highly reccomend watching [BroCode's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87SH2Cn0s9A&t=4620s) while reading the [cheatsheet.md](cheatsheet.md) and the .c source files
